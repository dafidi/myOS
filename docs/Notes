- Create 16GiB file
fallocate -l 16G <file-name>

- Copy all the bytes of fs.fs to an offset of 262144 * 512 bytes into disk.hdd.
dd if=fs.fs of=disk.hdd obs=512 seek=262144 conv=notrunc

- To disassemble nasm binary:
ndisasm # Linux

- Inspect fs components on disk. The params to be aware of are start, skip and length

START_SECTOR = COMPONENT_START_SECTOR
SKIP (depends on where in the component you want to start reading from)
LENGTH (depends on how much data you want to view)

hexdump -C -s $((START_SECTOR * 512 + (SKIP) -n LENGTH)) disk.hdd

-- Inspect 1024 bytes skipping the first 8404993 bytes of the sector_bitmap:
(This example skips the first 8404993 / 8 bytes because that is how many bytes are occupied
by the fs components and we want to view the bits used by the files & folders, not the
fs components.)
hexdump -C -s $((8193 * 512 + (8404993 / 8))) -n 1024 disk.hdd
